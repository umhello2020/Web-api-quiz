# Web API Quiz

## Description
This quiz was developed by hand to help further my knowledge of web api's and combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
I developed questions in this quiz that I believed covered some of the basic fundamentals of JavaScript that a fellow baby developer would learn/know. 
Being able to explain the code to my colleagues and work through it with them has really helped me to grasp a better understanding of how everything works together.
Even though this is a basic project, I hope that all other baby developers will rejoice with me.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
The purpose of this quiz is to quiz users on their knowledge of basic JavaScript fundamentals. 
In the top left corner there is a link to the highscore page with an ordered list of all the highscores of other users inluding their initials and score.
There are two buttons at the bottom of the page, one to clear the score list, and the other to take you back to the quiz start screen.
In the top right corner of the start screen there will be a timer to countdown how much time you will have during the quiz. 
When you click the 'Start Quiz' button, the timer will start and the questions and choices will replace the start page.
You will receive feedback at the bottom of the screen to tell you if your answer was right or wrong.
For each wrong answer, the timer will subtract 10 seconds from your time. 
Once you have reached the end of the questions or your time has run out, the end page will replace the questions and you will be shown your score.
There will be an input box so you can input your initials to save your score.
I tried to be a little intuitive and added a function to save the score if you hit the enter key instead of clicking the submit button since I most commonly use the enter key to submit things.
